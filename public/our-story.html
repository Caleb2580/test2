            It's all Jennifer's fault...  Ok, technically it's her parent's fault.  :)
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Jennifer spent her youth sailing with her parents and two younger sisters on Texas lakes.  She started at the age of five sailing on Lake Lewisville on a Catalina 22.  Later they progressed to an Endeavor 32 which they sailed on Lake Texoma (near Texas/Oklahoma border) until her high school years.  They spent many weekends "camping" on the water.  
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Scott and Jennifer met in their freshman year at college.  Jennifer spoke of her youth, but this family activity was completely foreign to Scott.  As their relationship progressed, there was talk about a future of sailing together - foreshadowing.  Scott had zero sailing DNA in his blood. 
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            While dating, Scott was eventually introduced to windsurfing by her parents who still had these boat toys.  Scott wore himself trying to learn to sail on a windsurfer.  Eventually he was introduced to Jennifer's childhood boat, a Dolphin Senior which was just big enough for two people.  
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            After marriage and a couple degrees, it didn't take long for us to acquire our first real sailboat - a Catalina 22 - just like her parents.  There were many day sails with friends on Galveston Bay.  
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            With Jennifer's parents being boatless and relocating with their jobs to Houston, there was a joint interest to acquire a boat together.  We eventually partnered on a Sabre 32 which we named "Forget Me Knot" dedicated to creating many memories together with family and friends.  Due to space and boat length (speed), this boat opened up a whole new world of adventure which included day sails across Trinity Bay, down to Galveston for Thanksgiving, and several offshore races in the Harvest Moon regatta.  With the challenge of kids and careers, and Jennifer's parents retiring, Forget Me Knot was fully acquired by her parents and they went on to liveaboard and pursue a life long goal of completing the "Great Loop" (basically circling the US eastern seaboard, up through the Great Lakes, and down the river systems, and into the Gulf of Mexico).  
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2018, Jennifer and Scott moved the family of five (Logan, Caleb, and Alyssa) to Dallas for a career opportunity.  Despite Jennifer's background growing up sailing in Dallas, sailing was not on anyone's mind with the relocation.  Until...  a birthday cheeseburger was had at a local marina on Lake Grapevine.  It would turnout to be the most expensive cheeseburger we ever bought.  
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            It took a couple years, and a worldwide pandemic, but we bought a Catalina 320 on Lake Grapevine in 2020.  The boat literally felt rusty as we test sailed her, but our skills were quite rusty too.  It didn't take long, and this became our families obsession for the next 2 years.  We participated in the sailing clubs regattas, socials, and related events which expedited our knowledge AND rekindled a conversation literally decades before - the concept of sailing the world.  
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            During this time, our middle son Caleb was in high school and had a band friend who volunteered and competed in the junior sailing program.  After a quick introductory test sail, he was hooked.  There is something special about the youth learning to do things with their hands and having the independent responsibility to navigate a boat by the invisible force called wind.  Alyssa (our daughter, seven years old at the time) was in the background but watching/cheering for her brother from shore and coach boats during competitions.  Following in her mom's footsteps, it didn't take long before Alyssa became the captain of her own boat, an Optimist (Opti for short).  Caleb and Alyssa would spend the next two summers together in summer camp.  Caleb as a counselor and Alyssa as a camper.  
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the background, Daddy was shopping for a boat for an even bigger adventure.  It would take about 18 months for us to find our dreamboat.  The process to find that boat is a story in itself (to be covered in an eventual blog post).  That dreamboat would turn out to be a 1995 Taswell 43.  While almost 30 years old, this Taiwanese build is a trusted/salty bluewater boat.  We purchased her from a very loving couple from Massachusetts who had named her "Heartstring".  After an intense family "vacation" to sail her to the Chesapeake (another pending blog post), she safely arrived to her home in the Chesapeake where she has laid "on the hard" (on stilts in a parking lot) since then. 
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            While many hours and a few B.O.A.T. bucks have been invested in her from afar, she awaits her owners arrival.  As is said in boating - "a ship in a harbor is safe, but that's not what ships are built for".  We are excited about this next chapter in our life which involves taking a sabatical, selling it all (ok, mostly all and still not enough), homeschooling, and just learning the basic survival skills of being independent living at sea.  We are truly excited and blessed for this opportunity!  Feel free to stay tuned through our blog!
